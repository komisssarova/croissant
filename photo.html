    <h3>Method</h3>

        STEP 1 Put the flour, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Measure 300ml
        cold water into a jug, add the yeast and stir. Make a well in the flour
        and pour in the liquid. Mix, then knead on your work surface for 10
        mins. Shape into a ball, put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and chill
        for at least 2 hrs. STEP 2 Put the butter between 2 sheets of baking
        parchment. Using a rolling pin, bash and roll it into a rectangle about
        20 x 15cm. Leave wrapped in the baking parchment and chill. STEP 3
        Transfer the chilled dough to a floured surface and roll into a 40 x
        20cm rectangle. Place the unwrapped slab of butter in the centre of the
        dough, so that it covers the middle third. STEP 4 Fold one side of the
        dough up and halfway over the butter. STEP 5 Fold the other side of the
        dough up and over the butter in the same way, so that the two edges of
        the dough meet in the centre of the butter. STEP 6 Fold the dough in
        half so that the point where the ends of the dough meet becomes the
        seam. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins. STEP 7 Repeat the
        rolling, folding and chilling process (steps 3-6) twice more in exactly
        the same way ‚Äì rolling the pastry while it‚Äôs still folded ‚Äì without
        adding more butter. Wrap and chill overnight. STEP 8 The next day, roll
        the dough out on a floured surface into a large rectangle, measuring
        about 60 x 30cm. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, trim the edges to
        neaten. STEP 9 Cut the dough in half lengthways so that you have 2 long
        strips, then cut each strip into 6 or 7 triangles with 2 equal sides.
        STEP 10 Take each triangle in turn and pull the two corners at the base
        to stretch and widen it. STEP 11 Starting at the base of each triangle,
        begin to gently roll into a croissant, being careful not to crush the
        dough. STEP 12 Continue rolling, making sure the tip of each triangle
        ends up tucked under the croissant to hold in place. If adding any
        fillings (see tips, below), place across the widest part of the triangle
        before rolling up. STEP 13 Bend the ends of the croissants inwards, then
        transfer to baking trays lined with baking parchment, spaced well apart.
        Cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 2 hrs, or
        until doubled in size. STEP 14 Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix the
        beaten egg with a pinch of salt and use to generously glaze the
        croissants. Bake for 15-18 mins until risen and golden brown, then cool
        on wire racks.
